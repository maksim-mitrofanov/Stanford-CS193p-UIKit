# Assignment 3 - Graphical Set

## Objective
The objective of Assignment III: Graphical Set is to gain the experience of building a custom view with multitouch gestures by modifying the code from Assignment II. The assignment requires the implementation of a game of Set with an improved user interface that includes dynamic card sizing, the ability to deal more cards, and a reshuffling feature.

## Required Tasks (short)
- The application must play a solo game of Set as required in Assignment II.
- Implement the ability to deal 3 more cards when the user requests it. The Deal 3 More Cards button should be disabled when there are no more cards left in the deck.
 - Cards should be as large as possible given the screen real estate available to cards and the number of cards currently in play. No space should be pre-allocated for all 81 possible cards.
- When 3 cards are matched and there are no more cards in the Set deck, the matching cards should be removed from the screen entirely and the remaining cards should "re-form up" to use the space freed up by these departing cards.
- The card symbols must scale with the size of the card.
- The symbols on cards with more than one symbol may be drawn horizontally or vertically.
- Tapping a card should select/deselect it.
- The game must work properly and look good in both Landscape and Portrait orientations on all iPhones and iPads. It should efficiently use all the available space in all circumstances.
