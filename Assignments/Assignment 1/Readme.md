# Assignment 1 - Concentration

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to recreate and enhance the Concentration game demonstrated in lectures using Xcode. The tasks include replicating the initial game, adding more cards, implementing a "New Game" button, shuffling the cards, creating a theme for the game, implementing a game score label, modifying the architecture to follow the proper MVC pattern, and ensuring all new UI components look good in portrait mode on an iPhone X.

## Required Tasks (short)
- Replicate the Concentration game demonstrated in lectures, without copying any code.
- Add more cards to the game.
- Add a "New Game" button to the UI to start a new game and end the current one.
- Shuffle the cards in the Concentration's init() method to randomize their position.
- Implement a "theme" for the game, and make sure that the game has at least 6 different themes, with a random theme chosen each time a new game starts.
- Make it easy to add a new theme in a single line of code.
- Add a game score label to the UI, giving 2 points for every match, and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card involved in a mismatch.
- Modify the architecture to follow the proper MVC pattern by moving the flip count tracking out of the Controller.
- Ensure that all new UI components added look good in portrait mode on an iPhone X.
