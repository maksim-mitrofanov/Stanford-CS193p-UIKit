## Lecture Topic
Persistence and Documents Demo

## Objective 
1. Create a new app called Document EmojiArt that is based on the EmojiArt app, that was created in the previous lecture.
2. The Document EmojiArt app should extend the functionality of the EmojiArt (allow users to draw, add background image, use collection view etc).
3. Make EmojiArt data model codable, so it can be saved and retrieved, when the app is relaunched.
4. Embed EmojiArt into a DocumentBrowserVC, to provide a new UI for users to create new EmojiArt documents.
